HTML:

1/5: Basic HTML structure is present: HTML structures has been used a lot.

2/5: HTML structure with clear content differentiation (headings, paragraphs, lists): Has been used in many places, clearly visible in code

3/5: Use of forms, links, and media: Page has a form at page.html row 184 and some images allaround.

4/5: Tables are effectively used: Visible at page.html row 56.

5/5: Consistent use of semantic HTML throughout, ensuring better structure and understanding of the content: page.html has a header / row 13 nav / row 15 section / row 148 footer / row 194

CSS:

1/5: Basic CSS styling (colors, fonts): Everywhere in style.css

2/5: Use of classes and IDs to style specific elements: Everywhere, page.html example row 34

3/5: Implementation of responsive design elements: In style.css, from row 368, if mediascreen goes below 600px, styles will change

4/5: Use of layouts for advanced user interfaces (arrays, float, flexbox, css grid): Used in many places in style.css, example row 76

5/5: Styling demonstrates a strong grasp of layout principles, aesthetics, and user experience. I think i got that.

JavaScript Basics:

1/5: Simple interactions (like alerts on button click): Multiple button on website, visible in script.js page.hmtl example row 97

2/5: Multiple event listeners and basic DOM manipulations: page.html example row 153 page.html example row 188

3/5: Use of arrays, objects, and functions: script.js example row 30 script.js example row 61 script.js example row 109

4/5: Advanced logic, looping through data, and dynamic DOM updates: script.js example row 1 script.js example row 2

5/5: Consistent use of Object-Oriented JavaScript principles: I think i got that.

Asynchronous Operations:

1/5: Use of timers: script.js example rows 49-52 script.js example rows 87-90

2/5: Successful implementation of an AJAX call or Fetch: script.js example row 7

3/5: Data from the asynchronous call is displayed on the webpage: page.hmtl rows 148-166 (also visible in page, weather api)

4/5: Error handling is implemented (for failed API calls, etc.): script.js example rows 43-53

5/5: Effective use of asynchronous data to enhance user experience (like filtering, sorting): Not 100% sure if i got that, but atleast i know what it means.
